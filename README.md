Required packages in environment.yml file. (Some packages may be redundant)

Src folder gives the functions for generating symplectic matrices, and converting between Gaussian state and graphs. A few functions are directly borrowed from thewalrus, so need to add some disclaimers before making this public. I try to avoid using thewalrus package directly, because thewalrus works in a dimensional quadrature basis, where there is a hbar in the commutation relations. I don't like this convention.
